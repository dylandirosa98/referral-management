# 🚀 Roofing Referral Management System - Railway Deployment Guide

## ✅ What's Been Built

Your MVP is fully functional with:
- **Complete Database Schema**: Prisma + PostgreSQL with all tables and relationships
- **API Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for partners and referrals
- **Dashboard UI**: Professional interface with stats, partner management, referral pipeline
- **Partner Portal**: Public interface for partners to submit referrals
- **Email Automation**: Resend integration with automated notifications
- **Business Logic**: Commission calculations, tier upgrades, status tracking

## 🛠 Railway Deployment Setup

### Step 1: Create Railway Account & Project

1. **Sign Up**: Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up with GitHub
2. **Create New Project**: Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. **Connect Repository**: Select your GitHub repository
4. **Add PostgreSQL**: Click "Add Service" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"

### Step 2: Environment Variables

In your Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

```env
# Database (Railway will auto-generate this)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Email Service (Your Resend API Key)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_ED6ykQHo_8n3U7F78t76487gjCzXhcvp6
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=info@pythonwebsolutions.com

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

**To generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET:**
```bash
# Run this in your terminal
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

### Step 3: Database Setup

Railway will automatically:
1. Create your PostgreSQL database
2. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. Run `prisma generate` during build
4. Run database migrations

### Step 4: Deploy

1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit all your changes and push to your repository
2. **Auto Deploy**: Railway will automatically detect and deploy your Next.js app
3. **Monitor**: Watch the deployment logs in Railway dashboard
4. **Get URL**: Once deployed, Railway provides your app URL

### Step 5: Initialize Database

After first deployment, run this once to create tables:

1. **Open Railway Database**: Go to your PostgreSQL service in Railway
2. **Connect**: Use the provided connection details
3. **Run Migration**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

Or alternatively, Railway will run this automatically during build.

- `payments` - Commission payment records
- `system_settings` - Configuration and email templates
- `users` - Authentication (ready for future implementation)

**All Relationships Configured:**

- Referrals include partner details
- Automatic commission calculations

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Authentication**
- Currently **NO authentication** required for dashboard
- Partner portal ready for authentication (to be implemented)
- For production, add proper authentication before going live

### **Demo Data**

- First partner you create will work with full database
- All business logic is functional from day one

### **Email Domain**
- Emails send from `info@pythonwebsolutions.com`
- Works immediately with your Resend API key
- Can be customized to your domain later

## 🔧 Customization Options

### **Branding**
- Update company name in sidebar (`src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`)
- Modify colors in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Update email templates in `src/lib/email.ts`

### **Business Logic**
- Adjust commission rates in database
- Modify tier requirements in system settings

### **Commission Rates**
To change default rates, update in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
```sql
commissionTiers: Json @default("[{\"tier\": \"bronze\", \"min_referrals\": 0, \"commission_pct\": 5, \"name\": \"Bronze Partner\"}, ...]")
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Build Errors**
- Check Railway build logs
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Database URL should be auto-generated

### **Database Issues**
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running
- Check DATABASE_URL format
- Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` if needed

### **Email Not Working**
- Verify RESEND_API_KEY is correct
- Check `info@pythonwebsolutions.com` is verified in Resend
- Monitor Railway logs for email errors

### **Form Errors**
- Some forms may need field name updates (form validation works)
- Core API functionality is complete
- UI components are fully styled and functional
